## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Currently the members at my church get weekly emails, which sometimes goes to spam or church members have to dig in the email box for what the weekly Bible reading is. A solution to this problem would be to create a web app containing access, for each member, to the weekly Bible readings. The web app would help members keep on track with the weekly Bible readings. 
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the web application. Users wonâ€™t be required to log in unless they want to access the progress tracking feature. 

View Reading: Users will be able to view the verses for the week and click on the verse for a day of the week, which will take them to another page. Users will be able to access any reading for any previous and future week.

Progress Tracking: Users will be able to track the progess of their weekly readings.
